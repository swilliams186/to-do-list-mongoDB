# to-do-list-mongoDB
A bootcamp project from a recent Udemy course.
## An ExpressJS webapp using a NoSQL MongoDB, implemented using both the Mongoose ODM and the MongoDB native driver.

This is currently hosted and active - however I didn't pay for hosting so expect it to be very slow if it hasn't been used in a while. Any extension is accessible and dynamically creates
a new list at that uri. 

This was my first experience using NoSQL, and as someone who is quite familiar with SQL I initially found it quite... dreadful. Once I had gotten to grips with the flexibility
I came to quite enjoy it and understand how useful it can be! I implemented using 2 different methods so I could have a better understanding for the workings, and give myself more experience as
a whole.

I was also not very experienced with JS either, so this was a great first foray into a new langauge. I have since undertaken a few more projects and find myself quickly growing in
familiarity - although there is much for me to still learn!
